### Features used:

* NSOperation Subclasses
* Concurrent Operations
* GCD 
* Core Data
* Custom Upsert for Core Data
* Associated Object - (Not really necessary, but why not.)
* NSFetchedResultsController
* UIRefreshControl and sorta infinite scroll
* NSUserDefaults

### Note:
* Alot of this isn't really best practice, but mostly just me experimenting to learn what works and doesn't.
